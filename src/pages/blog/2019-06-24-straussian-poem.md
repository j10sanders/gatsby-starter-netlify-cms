I guess you'd have to know me  
(that impractical wish)  
to know what I don't write   
Can you quote a poem in a poem?   
Lines 1-3 are [Matt's](https://inpatientpress.bigcartel.com/product/heroic-dose-by-matt-longabucco)  
It's an absurd wish  
But [Strauss's case is compelling](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Between-Lines-History-Esoteric/dp/022617509X)  
That [they all did it:](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/sites/melzer/melzer_appendix.pdf)  
Spinoza was an atheist  
*The Prince* was shitting on monarchy  
Plato might be the worst offender  
etc etc...  
You have to know them, to know them  
If you have to be told everything, do not read me [-- J.J Rousseau](https://books.google.com/books?id=0c9jBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA220&ots=86aiqsRhpc&dq=%22if%20you%20have%20to%20be%20told%20everything%20do%20not%20read%20me%22%20rousseau&pg=PA220#v=onepage&q=%22if%20you%20have%20to%20be%20told%20everything%20do%20not%20read%20me%22%20rousseau&f=false)   
What I cannot express, I point to with my finger.  
But if you have a penetrating mind  
These little tracks will serve the rest to find [-- Montaigne](https://books.google.com/books?id=hlYPYVCBOhAC&lpg=PA181&ots=fHorMa04dW&dq=What%20I%20cannot%20express%2C%20I%20point%20to%20with%20my%20finger.%20But%20if%20you%20have%20a%20penetrating%20mind%2C%20These%20little%20tracks%20will%20serve%20the%20rest%20to%20find.%20montaigne&pg=PA181#v=onepage&q&f=false)  
Does this happen today?  
Or is nothing hidden anymore?  
If an actor doesn't talk about equality  
When they win an Oscar  
Something feels off  
It's what they don't say  
The strategy is simple  
But an impractical wish:  
Study their time, place, culture, and peers  
Maybe it's easier, the closer you are  
Let's figure out [Tyler](https://marginalrevolution.com/)  
On social issues, he's suspiciously quiet  
Because who would want to identify with the dark web  
Where safe spaces are now treasured  
The irony  
But [Clair](https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/claire-lehmann-tyler-cowen-political-correctness-social-norms-australian-culture-e52e2c08c629) and Jordan guest on [Conversations](https://conversationswithtyler.com/)  
To paraphrase a Q for Jordan:  
*Letâ€™s say one is of the view that men and women are different  
but one still recognizes discrimination against women...*   
Ha ha, Tyler  
You thought he was reasonable  
Jordan [does not play along](https://link.medium.com/BUXm2MHfGX)  
The answer hangs  
Reasonableness is isolating  
A follow up question can't come  
Damn it Jordan  
It was going so well  
You dig in too deep  
Until you are wrong  
What could you possibly be leaving out  
That impractical wish  
Where is the podcast  
Where they start with a dose of LSD  
Hop out of their narratives  
And watch a millipede  
Where are we  
That could be the name  
Spotify exclusive  
Apparently a [good thing](https://stratechery.com/2019/spotifys-podcast-aggregation-play/)  
Just 10 libra a month  
A parody of myself  
Is the most fun to write
