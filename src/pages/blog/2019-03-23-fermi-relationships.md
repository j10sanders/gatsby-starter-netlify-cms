Relationships, Vulnerability, and the Fermi Paradox

Is there, or has there ever been, life on Mars?  Of course not -- we can't find evidence of it with rovers, landers, or satellite imaging.  And it's nearly impossible to find a square foot of earth's surface that isn't teaming with life.  As far I can tell, life is like glitter: where it exists, it get's everywhere.

But what about elsewhere in the universe?  It seems that the universe might be analogous to Mars -- if we don't see evidence of intelligent life out there, then it's not there.  It would have spread and made itself noticeable to us.

Some people believe that we already have good evidence of alien intelligent life.  Maybe the Alex Jones theory of the universe is correct, and there are inter-dimensional beings (elves and such) that permeate our world and can be communicated with when a "gate" in our consciousness is opened up by hallucinogens.  Or maybe some UFO sightings are real.  I give the combination of these possibilities < .005% likelihood.  Why so low?  UFO sightings have gone way down now that we carry cameras around, and it's silly that I even wrote Alex Jones's name .  So given essentially 0 evidence of alien intelligent life, we can proceed to examine the Fermi Paradox, and what it means for us.

###Back-of-the-napkin fermi-paradox calculations:

The universe is 13.8 billion years old.  Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, and life on earth started 3.5 billion years ago.  So just one billion years between the formation of earth and the first signs of life.

Earth has existed for about 1/3 the age of the universe, but earth-life planets have existed since nearly the beginning: [12.8 billion years ago](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/11/28/what-was-it-like-when-the-first-habitable-planets-formed/#1d574a6361eb) seems to be a realistic estimate for the first life-supporting planets.  Quite a long time.

There are two trillion galaxies in the universe today.  I find this number to be even harder to wrap my head around than 12.8 billion years.  So, for the sake of the napkin, let's disregard this number, and focus on just our local Milky Way galaxy.  How many planets are earth-like in our galaxy?  Current estimates are between [17 billion](https://www.space.com/19157-billions-earth-size-alien-planets-aas221.html) and [40 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/science/cosmic-census-finds-billions-of-planets-that-could-be-like-earth.html) earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarf stars within the Milky Way galaxy. 

To recap: the formation of life-supporting planets started 12.8 billion years ago (8 billions years before Earth), and 17-40 billion of these types of planets are in our galaxy.  If life happened in only 0.1% of those planets, then there would be 17 to 40 million planets in the Milky Way that have been lived on.

The Fermi Paradox is essentially the question, "given the billions of years of head start that billions of life-supporting planets have had in our galaxy, why haven't we seen any evidence of life?  Shouldn't signals be visible everywhere?  Shouldn't our galaxy be teaming with spaceships?  Shouldn't sophisticated life that existed millions of years ago have left evidence of their existence, like huge clusters of [dyson spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere)?"

A bunch of "solutions" to the paradox have been theorized.  Among the most popular are:
	- We've just missed the signals.  Literally billions of years have gone by in which intelligent life could have sent us signals, but we have only had technology to intercept signals such as radio waves for mere centuries.
	- We aren't worth communicating with.  Super intelligent species are communicating on another level, and see no reason to use primitive technologies like radio wave.
	- Traveling isn't interesting.  Sending something at super fast speeds (even light speed) isn't worth the effort.  It would still take potentially thousands of years to get to other intelligent life, and then would take just as long to send a signal back.
	- A number of technological "filters" exist ahead of us, and all other intelligent life has been destroyed by such filters, before getting to the point of providing us with evidence of their existence.  So at some point we will discover a technology that destroys us, (through something like nuclear war, climate change, or [AI](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/doomsday-invention-artificial-intelligence-nick-bostrom)), and suffer the same fate as all other intelligent life.

But I think that the best answer to this paradox was written by [Sandberg, Drexler, and Ord](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02404) where they claim to "dissolve" the paradox.  Unlike the other solutions I listed above, SDO don't claim that intelligent life exists and we are just missing their signals (or that it existed but destroyed itself).  Instead, in their paper, my estimate of life happening in "only 0.1%" of earth-like planets is ridiculously high.  By using "models of chemical and genetic transitions on paths to the origin of life" in a "synthetic point estimate" model, they find "a substantial probability of there being no other intelligent life in our observable universe". [more here](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/03/ssc-journal-club-dissolving-the-fermi-paradox/)  So it's not a paradox -- it's just supremely unlikely for life to exist, and we shouldn't be surprised that we are the only intelligent life in our corner of the universe.

So let's take SDO seriously (which I think we should), and say that we are probably alone.  Does this matter?  Well, what matters?  As far as I can tell, what matters, or what has meaning, comes out of our relationships.  This is a strong claim, so what are relationships?

###What is a relationship?

Let's start by looking at a two person, loving relationship.  I used to think of relationships as existing within each person.  Under this model, affection, commitment, and support for the other person is essentially "repaid" by the other.  So each person gives and receives, which can be mutually beneficial.

Recently, however, I've started developing a new model, where the relationship exists outside of the individuals - through a shared vulnerability.  A specific, temporal vulnerability in the world.

When we realize that our allotted time is short and fleeting, our vulnerability becomes a blatant fact.  And we have to do something about it, or risk becoming [alienated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard#Alienation) by it.  The answer is simple - we have to share it.

This is why we have relationships.  Because the shared experiences throughout a relationship give deeper meaning to events, because each person cares about how the events affect the other.  It makes us close and connected, not just to each other, but to the world.  The world, at a specific time and place, becomes more significant.  More meaningful.   This is why being close to someone is so vital.

Relationships are also forward-looking.  A strong relationship should compound -- 'meaning' should be built out of 'meaning'.  And this only works if each person understands the other.  And cares, and worries about, and want's the best for the other, unselfishly.  Unselfishly, because the commitment to the other is not something that the other holds them to -- it's something each person chooses for themselves. Then the couple can be honest with each other, which means their shared vulnerability to life and the world is real and unambiguous.  I think that this is how love works.

Like the "relationship is in the individuals" model, there are still mutual benefits to the relationship.  But unlike that model, "meaning" is created, and exists outside of the individuals.

When a relationship fails, this shared relation to time, place, and the world, is shattered.  The "meaning" tied up in memories is rooted out of the past like a weed, leaving events that are nigh-impossible to rearrange into something coherent and worthwhile.  This is why a couple that grows old together is so beautiful (but only if they do so of their own free choice).  And why a breakup is so tragic.  It's why a relationship is worth fighting for.  It's also why lying is wrong.  Because truth and meaning are all we have, and if we lose them, we become alienated in the world.  There are a thousand things fighting against (evolution for instance) - but if the love is deep enough -- if the shared vulnerability was and is honest enough, then it's not that "love is worth fighting for".  Rather, "meaning is worth fighting for".  So love stands a chance.

I've heard mystics, and someone who did way too much LSD in his life, say that "Love is everything."    A good friend of mine tried to dive into this with me, and ....


But if love loses, then it can't be everything?  Right?  Right.  The mystics notice that love is everywhere -- that relationships are real and more than biochemical signals in our brains.  We find meaning through them.  But damnit, it's not everything.  There is something else.

Would evidence of intelligent life out there make us more or less loving?  I don't know.  It would probably make us vegetarians.  After all, if we are far less intelligent than another species, then our rational for factory-farming less-intelligent species backfires.
