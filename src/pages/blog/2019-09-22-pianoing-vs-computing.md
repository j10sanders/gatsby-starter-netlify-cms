I recently started learning to play the piano.  I've talked about how powerlifting is similar to coding, but in this episode, I'd like to talk about why playing the piano is different than coding.  More specifically, why composing music is different than coding, and why playing music is different than [running a program](link to something is running my javascript).

The similarities are easy to come up with: you need to practice frequently to become proficient, general concepts from one instrument apply well to other instruments (analogous to programming languages), music is written in a certain notation and then executed/played, etc...  But as I think about it, the differences are far more interesting than the similarities.

The analogs are: 
	Composing Music or Improvising vs Coding
	Playing Music vs Running a program (like a machine)


How composing music/improvising is different than coding:
	Bugs are fundamentally different.  A composer won't accidentally create an infinite loop or a stack overflow.  I guess you could make a song repeat indefinitely, but you can expect a human player to not get stuck in this trap.
	The notation, or the code is played, is not so separate from the outcome.  In programming, there is always a million ways to complete the same task.  Not so with music-- the details of the code make up the music -- you shouldn't expect different pieces of music to ultimately sound the same.
	Musical notation often isn't entirely sufficient.  It's not uncommon to see phrases such as "gradually increase the volume and energy", or "lively", etc...  I'm sure these notes could be codified - it would just be inconvenient, since the machine running the code is a human who also understands English.
	

How playing music is different from V8:
	The performance of playing music itself is something people pay to watch.  Concerts are only interesting if someone is playing the music there - live.  This is in start contrast to a web app - where we care about what we can do with the executed code. (need to think about this more)
	V8 doesn't practice.  If you think I'm missing something here - let me know!
	You can't move your abilities to another machine.  In fact, since no two people play the exact same way, we can't replicate any human performances across humans.
	The actual important differences:
		The Baumol effect
		Qualia

The Baumol Effect:
	The Baumol Effect is something I learned about on [The Not Unreasonable Podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/david-wright/the-not-unreasonable-podcast/e/62417129) where Alex Tabarrok discussed his book [Why Are the Prices So Damn High](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/helland-tabarrok_why-are-the-prices-so-damn-high_v2.pdf).
He talks about why prices for some things have been going up since, say, the 1950s, while the prices for most things have decreased.  So while home appliances and telecommunications have become much cheaper, prices for education and healthcare keep going up.

So the Baumol Effect makes it pretty clear that playing piano is not worth my time, since the productivity garnered out of it hasn't changed in centuries.  Maybe teaching has gotten slightly better, but certainly nothing dramatic has happened recently -- I'm learning from [a book published in 1998](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CXX7HEO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) after all.  In contrast, software (and by extension, software development) is "eating the world".  Even since I've been a programmer, I've seen dramatic increases in the ease of creating, deploying, and scaling a web application.
