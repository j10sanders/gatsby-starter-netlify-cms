I guess you'd have to know me
(that impractical wish)
to know what I don't write
Can you quote a poem in a poem?
Lines 1-3 are [Matt's](https://inpatientpress.bigcartel.com/product/heroic-dose-by-matt-longabucco)
It's an absurd wish
But Strauss's case is compelling
That they all did it:
Spinoza was an atheist
The Price was Machiavelli's effort to shit on monarchy
etc etc...
If you have to be told everything, do not read me 
[-- J.J Rousseau](https://books.google.com/books?id=0c9jBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA220&ots=86aiqsRhpc&dq=%22if%20you%20have%20to%20be%20told%20everything%20do%20not%20read%20me%22%20rousseau&pg=PA220#v=onepage&q=%22if%20you%20have%20to%20be%20told%20everything%20do%20not%20read%20me%22%20rousseau&f=false)
What I cannot express, I point to with my finger.
But if you have a penatrating mind,
These little tracks will serve the rest to find.
[--Montaigne](https://books.google.com/books?id=hlYPYVCBOhAC&lpg=PA181&ots=fHorMa04dW&dq=What%20I%20cannot%20express%2C%20I%20point%20to%20with%20my%20finger.%20But%20if%20you%20have%20a%20penetrating%20mind%2C%20These%20little%20tracks%20will%20serve%20the%20rest%20to%20find.%20montaigne&pg=PA181#v=onepage&q&f=false)
Does this still happen today?
Or do we write exactly what we mean?
We do it all the time, but now we fool ourselves
If an actor doesn't talk about equality
When they win an Oscar
Or tell us that racism is still real
What do we assume?
It's what they don't say
The strategy is simple
But an impractical wish
Study their time, place, culture, and peers
