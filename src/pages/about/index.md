My name is Jonathan Sanders, and I'm a programmer because I like making things. I'm fascinated by web3 technologies and I'm a bit of a React fanboy.

Non-progamming things that I enjoy include: [inari](https://pogogi.com/what-inari-sushi-and-how-make-it), [mandolin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xeLXC5Ph98), [board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/232405/western-legends), [powerlifting](http://usapl.liftingdatabase.com/lifters-view?id=37768), and [cheesecake](https://www.wsj.com/articles/evolution-of-new-yorks-cheesecake-1376270944).
